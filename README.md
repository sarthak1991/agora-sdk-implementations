# Agora Video Call Project

Demo for a web-based video calling application using the Agora RTC SDK for video and
audio communications and the Agora Signaling SDK for messaging.

```

### Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd agora-test
```

  npm install
```

### Start the server




```bash
  npm run start
```
